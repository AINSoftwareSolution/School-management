      question: "Why is Preschool education important?",
      answer: "Research has proved that up to the age of 5 years, the brain forms as many as 700 neural connections per second. As the pace of development in these early years is extremely rapid, it becomes crucial to give the right knowledge, exposure and experiences to the children at this stage. The impressions formed in their minds during these formative years are known to last a lifetime."

      question: "What is the right time to send a child to preschool?",
